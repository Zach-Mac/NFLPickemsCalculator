    BUG: 0 0 no tie color

Paste picks table once per week. Should be behind upload.
Use api to figure out game results info. Extra button to manually update game results info.
Pick game winners is a temp view just for table numbers but no influence on stats? Can use manual game update button in order to update stats?
