    BUG: 0 0 no tie color

Paste picks table once per week. Should be behind upload.
Use api to figure out game results info. Extra button to manually update game results info.
Pick game winners is a temp view just for table numbers but no influence on stats? Can use manual game update button in order to update stats?

build headers based on espn data then upload picks selection

1. load espn data and build headers
2. check if saved picks data matches
3. if yes, load table, if no: display error and say to upload picks
4. before loading table, reorder games array to match picks order
